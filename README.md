- Hello!
- 
- My name is Max! I am a fourth-year student, studying Business at the Schulich School of Business.
- I am currently specializing in Economics and Operations Management/Data Analytics, and have fallen in love working with data.
- Hence, I have deep aspirations to one day become a Data Scientist! 
-
-On my Git, I've uploaded some scripts I've had the pleasure to develop in some of my current undergraduate classes. Please feel free to let me know what you think!
-
- Enjoy!
