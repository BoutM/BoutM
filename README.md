Hello!

My name is Max, I am Masters student at the University of Wateloo. I am currently working towards the completion of the Masters of Computational Mathematics program. That being said, I specialize in Machine Learning, Data Science, Numerical methods, Operations and Econometrics. Having completed a BBA undergraduate at the Schulich School of Business, I understand not only the theoreticals of mathamtical and statistical techniques, but how to effectively apply them in a wide range of situations. Please feel free to explore my projects to get a better understanding of my knoledge and potential skills!
