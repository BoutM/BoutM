Hello!
-
- My name is Max! I am graduate student at the University of Wateloo. I am currently working towards completing the Masters of Computational Mathematics program. That being said, I specialize in Data Science, Optimization, Operations and Econometrics. That is, not only am I able to utilize an dunderstand advanced Machine Learning Techniques, but also gather inferences/economic interperability from them. I've uploaded some projects that I've developed over the years to my repository. Feel free to explore them!
