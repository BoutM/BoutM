Hello!

My name is Max, I am Masters student at the University of Wateloo. I am currently working towards the completion of the Masters of Computational Mathematics program. in 2024, I graduated from the Schulich School of Business, York University, with honours and distinction. 

I specialize in the areas of Machine Learning, Data Science, Numerical methods, Business Operations and Econometrics. Not only do I have an in-depth understanding of the theoretics of mathematical, statistical and economic techniques, but also how to effectively implement them to solve a wide range of problems! By exploring some of my projects, you should get a better understanding of my knowledge and potential skills!


Thanks! 


Max
